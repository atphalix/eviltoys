Compiling ezQuake sources on Windows: (updated Jan 12, 2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Sources are compilable with Microsoft Visual Studio 8 (2005). Older versions (6, 7, 7.1) may have problems in project files ***



Instructions:
--------------------
1) Grab source from ezquake CVS:
 - cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@ezquake.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ezquake
 - checkout module ezquake:
 - cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@ezquake.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ezquake co -P ezquake

2) Get Microsoft Visual Studio 8 and install it. Insteand of expensive MSVS8 you can install Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition which is free.
 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/downloads/default.aspx
 - just follow instructions

3) Get platfrom SDK and set it up
 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/default.aspx
 - just follow instructions

4) Download all required libraries, there are two ways to do it:
 A) Go to http://ezquake.cvs.sourceforge.net/ezquake/libs/windows-x86/
    and manually download all *.lib files from there, save them into libs\windows-x86 directory
 B) Go to libs/windows-x86 dir and launch download.bat
    *** This requires you to have wget.exe present in your system. if you don't have it, download it from: ***
    http://www.christopherlewis.com/WGet/wget-1.10.2b.zip
    and place wget.exe either in the same dir as download.bat or in your system dir

5) Download x86 assembler tools, there are two ways to do it:
 A) Go to http://ezquake.cvs.sourceforge.net/ezquake/libs/windows-x86/
    and manually download gas2masm.exe and ML.EXE files from there, save them into masm32 directory
 B) Go to masm32 dir and launch download.bat
    *** This requires you to have wget.exe present in your system. if you don't have it, download it from: ***
    http://www.christopherlewis.com/WGet/wget-1.10.2b.zip
    and place wget.exe either in the same dir as download.bat or in your system dir

6) Open open ezquake_msvs_80.sln located in ezquake/make/msvs2005

7) Select GLDebug configuration and press "Build".




Microsoft Visual Studio 8 and .s (asm) files:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Requirements:
   There are no special requirements, we include everything in CVS, you just need cl.exe
   which is a part of MS VS 8 package
 - We use Custom Build Tool to compile asm .s files in MS VS 8.
 - Visual Studio reads all instructions from qasm.rules
 - That file is included in the project file (ezquake_msvs_80.vcproj)
 - Instructions are named 'qasm' and are applied on *.s files
 - Visual Studio 8 doesn't have ml.exe (known as masm32) so we have ml.exe in masm32 dir (binary in CVS)
 - We dont include gas2masm in ezquake solution
 - gas2masm.exe is stored in our CVS
 - How custom build works:
   1) cl (optimizer), input is .s file, output is .spp (optimized) file
   2) gas2masm, input is .spp file, output is .asm file
   3) ml, input .asm file, output is .obj file
   4) intermediate .spp and .asm files are deleted
   5) .obj file is then used by the linker




Troubleshooting:
---------------------------
- If you get "unresolved external symbol __imp__" linker errors, you need to edit the corewin_express.vsprops file (found in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\VCProjectDefaults) and change the string that reads: AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib" to AdditionalDependencies="kernel32.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib winspool.lib comdlg32.lib advapi32.lib shell32.lib ole32.lib oleaut32.lib uuid.lib"

Developer notes:
---------------------------
Detailed changelog:
"C:\Program Files\TortoiseCVS\cvs" -d:ext:USERNAME@ezquake.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ezquake log -d "2006-06-01<" -b -N > log.log < empty.txt
- this will dump all the changes from cvs logs from 2006-06-01 to now on into log.log
- requires CVS_RSH environmental variable set to putty's plink.exe path (control panel -> system -> ...)
- this log should be uploaded into /test/changelogs/ dir on the shell (web)
- in http://ezquake.sf.net/test/changelogs/ there is an php file which parses such changelogs into an overall
  detailed changelog page and extract usefull info from all those logs
- naming convention for .log files is "Until_yyyy-mm-dd.log", yyyy = year, mm = month, dd = day

Debugger detected:
- Error warning that MS VS gives you when you try to run debug build in your quake dir. Solution: move ezquake-security.dll out of your quake dir
