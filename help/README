1 What is EvitToys? 
--------------------
  it's a 3D educational video game for children, to learn about danger of landmines
  and cluster munitions, by playing inside a virtual world and learning to recognize them and avoid them.
  the child will also learn signs that indicate dangerous area. Which make the child adopt safe behaviour 
  when faced with similar situation in real life.
  I hope through playing and learning with this software, it will contribute to saving children life in countries affected by war.

2 How to play 
--------------

2.1 Navigation 
===============
  You can navigate through the virtual world by using keyboard arrow keys and mouse:

    key         Description                      
   -----------+---------------------------------
    UP KEY      Move forward                     
    DOWN KEY    Move backward                    
    LEFT KEY    Slide left                       
    RIGHT KEY   Slide right                      
    SPACE KEY   Jump up                          
    MOUSE       Use mouse to choose a direction  
                and keyboard to move forward     

2.2 Buttons and doors 
======================
   Some doors are closed, to open them and access new areas, you need to press red button near the door.

2.3 Unexploded ordnance and mines 
==================================
   To progress in the game and discover new secret areas, you need to avoid getting near mines because they explode
   and will hurt you. you can avoid them by watching them closely in the museum, and by staying away when you see danger sign.
   

2.4 The museum 
===============
   is found in beginning of the game, it is the only safe place where the child can get close to mines and see them and remember their shape
   as he need to avoid getting near them later in the game.

2.5 Purple diamond 
===================
   You need to collect all purple diamond that you can find, every one give you more health and help you to survive and continue playing.
   the diamond is only thing you need to collect in the game and being choosed as color purple is rarely used in military on in nature and
   shape cannot be confused with explosives. so the child will not look for them or confuse them with dangerous object in real life .
