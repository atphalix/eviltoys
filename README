== What ``Free Software'' means

When we speak of Free Software, we refer to the software movement in
which your freedoms to use, copy, modify, and study it are ensured.  For
example, you may freely use Freedoom for any purpose you see fit, you
may redistribute it to anyone without needing to ask for permission, you
may modify it (provided you keep the license intact, see `COPYING`), and
you may study it -- for example, to see how a Quake pak file is built.  To
facilitate this, you can get the full source code.

You may read more about Free Software at the http://www.gnu.org/ (GNU)
and http://www.fsf.org/ (Free Software Foundation) websites.
