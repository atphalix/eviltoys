* How to build
** darkplaces Quake engine source
download stable version from:
http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/download.html
Or latest development version in the Subversion Repository
Accessing the SVN server can be done with this commandline:
svn co svn://svn.icculus.org/twilight/trunk/darkplaces darkplaces
** building game data
You need first to compile the tools that will build the game data inside the directory
openquartz/utils 
and in
openquartz/utils/qutils
make

cd openquartz/pak0
make && make install
which will compile all game data and copy them inside your quake engine dir
(you need to change GAMEDIR variable in makefile to where you installed your engine)
